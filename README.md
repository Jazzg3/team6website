# Project Description

### The Problem:
People who are dealing with hearing loss or unable to speak face challenges in communicating with those unfamiliar with sign language without an interpreter. 

### The Solution:
A live closed captioning system for ASL, utilizing machine learning and displays the translation onto an OLED display attached to the person signing.
